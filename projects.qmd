ChromaAnalyzer is a Windows application used for Transitional Analysis (TA) of chromatography data generated in the pharmaceutical industry.

TA is a non-intrusive, in-process method for evaluating packed-column performance. Instead of resource-intensive, point-in-time measurements of resin integrity, ChromaAnalyzer can provide near real time performance metrics. 

Traditionally the use of TA has required specialist expertise in signal processing and custom code or expensive subscriptions to commercial software. ChromaAnalyzer avoids both.

VintScout is a self-hosted web application for monitoring Vinted marketplaces. Vinted does not support notifications, so VintScout creates custom alerts and sends notifications when new items matching your criteria are listed.

The app features smart search with autocomplete brand search, visual category tree navigation, and condition filters. It supports monitoring across 20+ European Vinted marketplaces with instant Telegram notifications when matches are found.

VintScout is designed for self-hosting with complete data control and includes one-command deployment with Docker Compose. Future development includes email notifications, size and color filters, and improved mobile responsiveness.
