ChromaAnalyzer is a Windows application used for Transitional Analysis (TA) of chromatography data generated in the pharmaceutical industry.

TA is a non-intrusive, in-process method for evaluating packed-column performance. Instead of resource-intensive, point-in-time measurements of resin integrity, ChromaAnalyzer can provide near real time performance metrics. 

Traditionally the use of TA has required specialist expertise in signal processing and custom code or expensive subscriptions to commercial software. ChromaAnalyzer avoids both.
